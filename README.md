## Who are we?

We are the [internet.taskforce.is](http://taskforce.is). The taskforce is a volunteer rapid response team dedicated to creating a platform to defend the internet. In addition, we create bespoke campaigns to support our goals.

We work with groups like the EFF, Mozilla, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Access and others similar organizations to coordinate and help make our internet advocacy campaigns more effective.
